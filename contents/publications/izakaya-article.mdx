## Abstract

This article traces the transformation of the Japanese izakaya from Edo-period standing sake bars to one of postwar Japan's most important democratic social institutions. Drawing on architectural analysis, economic history, and ethnographic observation, it examines how these informal drinking establishments became spaces where social hierarchy was temporarily dissolved — through counter seating, shared ordering rituals, and accessible pricing — contributing to the development of a more egalitarian urban culture in rapidly modernising Tokyo.

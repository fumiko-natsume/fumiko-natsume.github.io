  This thesis examines how the principles of traditional Japanese hospitality — omotenashi (おもてなし) —

## Abstract

This thesis examines how the principles of traditional Japanese hospitality — *omotenashi* (おもてなし) — can inform and improve research support practices in modern academic settings. Through ethnographic observation in Japanese hospitality venues, comparative analysis with Western academic support structures, and conceptual framework development grounded in Japanese aesthetic theory, it argues that truly excellent support is invisible: anticipatory, culturally intelligent, and designed to remove friction from the intellectual work it serves.

The study draws on the concepts of *ma* (間, negative space), *wabi-sabi* (侘寂, beauty in imperfection), and *omotenashi* to propose a practical framework for implementing these principles in international research environments. Awarded with Distinction.

I turned twenty-six today. It's also Hinamatsuri — Girls' Day — which means I share my birthday with a festival about elegance, tradition, and quiet feminine strength. I'll take it.

To celebrate, I want to write about something I know well: **drinks**. Not drinking — *drinks*. The difference matters.

## Three Vessels, One Philosophy

### Matcha

A proper bowl of matcha is not about caffeine. It is about **attention**. 

You heat the water to exactly 80°C — not boiling, never boiling. You sift the powder. You whisk with a chasen in a precise W motion until the surface is covered with a fine, jade-green foam. The whole process takes perhaps ninety seconds and requires your complete presence.

That presence is the point. The Japanese tea ceremony — *chadō* (茶道) — is not about tea. It is about being fully, completely *here*.

### Sake

My favourite sake is **Juyondai** (十四代). It is nearly impossible to find and worth every effort. But the magic of sake isn't in the rare bottles — it's in the relationship between the rice, the water, the koji, and the tōji (master brewer) who understands that fermentation is a conversation, not a process.

At fifteen, I could identify most sake by region and rice variety. Not because I was precocious — because my grandmother's restaurant in Kagurazaka served excellent sake, and I paid attention. Paying attention is the only secret worth knowing.

### Whisky

At Bar High Five in Ginza, I learned that making a drink is an act of hospitality. The bartender doesn't just pour whisky — they read the guest. Your mood, the weather, what you've eaten, whether you need comfort or surprise. Then they choose.

My personal favourite: **Hakushu 12 Year**. It tastes like a forest after rain — green, refreshing, alive. It is the whisky equivalent of opening a window on a spring morning.

## The Common Thread

Matcha, sake, whisky — three utterly different drinks from three different traditions. But they share a philosophy:

**The best things in life reward attention.**

Not expertise. Not wealth. Not even talent. Just attention. The willingness to slow down, notice the details, and care about getting it right.

This is what I learned in my grandmother's kitchen, behind the bar in Ginza, and in the quiet corners of Oxford's libraries. The perfect cup — of anything — is the one you made with your whole self present.

*Happy Hinamatsuri. Make yourself something beautiful today. Pay attention while you do it. That's all.*

When I first arrived at Oxford for my MPhil, I expected culture shock. What I didn't expect was recognition.

The ancient stone, the arcane rituals, the particular way light falls through the Bodleian windows — Oxford felt less foreign than it should have. It took me weeks to understand why: **Oxford and traditional Japan share a deep reverence for form**.

## Formal Hall as Kaiseki

At Exeter College, Formal Hall follows a precise choreography. You process in sub fusc. Latin grace is said. Courses arrive in order. There are rules about when you may leave, and how. The first time I attended, I thought: *this is kaiseki*.

In a kaiseki meal, every detail is considered — the season, the pottery, the sequence of flavours, the moment each dish arrives. Nothing is accidental. The form is the content. Oxford's rituals work the same way. Sub fusc isn't a costume; it's a statement that this moment matters enough to dress for it.

## The Turf Tavern Principle

But here's what I love about both cultures: beneath the formality, there is warmth. 

The Turf Tavern — my favourite Oxford pub — is hidden down an alley, requires local knowledge to find, and serves pints in a garden where the walls are older than most countries. It is, in Japanese terms, a perfect *yokocho* (横丁) — a hidden alley bar where the rules relax and conversation flows.

Every formal culture needs its Turf Tavern. In Tokyo, it's the tiny standing bars of Yurakucho. In Oxford, it's the pub you have to know how to find. The formality gives the informality its sweetness.

## Attention to Detail

The British and the Japanese share something else: an appreciation for **craft in everyday things**. 

A well-made cup of tea. A properly polished shoe. A letter written with the right pen on the right paper. These things are not fussy — they are acts of attention. They say: *I care about this moment enough to do it well*.

My grandmother would have understood Oxford perfectly. She would have approved of the stone, the gowns, the grace before meals. And then she would have found the best hidden pub and ordered a glass of wine.

## Finding Home

I came to Oxford as a visitor and found something unexpectedly familiar. The specifics are different — cobblestones instead of tatami, ale instead of sake, Latin instead of Japanese — but the underlying philosophy is the same: **some things are worth doing beautifully, even when no one is watching**.

Especially when no one is watching.

*Oxford taught me that home isn't a place — it's a philosophy. And mine has room for both matcha and Marmite.*

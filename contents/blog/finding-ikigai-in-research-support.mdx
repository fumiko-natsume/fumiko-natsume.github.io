There is a Japanese concept called **ikigai** (生きがい) — roughly translated as "a reason for being." It sits at the intersection of four things: what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for.

People often assume ikigai must be something grand. A calling. A destiny. But I found mine in something most people would consider thoroughly unglamorous: **research support**.

## The Invisible Craft

I support a DPhil researcher at the University of Oxford who works on clinical prediction models — the kind of AI that could help doctors make better decisions for patients with multiple long-term conditions. My job is to make the chaos manageable: schedules, correspondence, travel, regulations, the bureaucratic labyrinth that Oxford does so well.

It doesn't sound like *ikigai*, does it? But here's the thing.

My grandmother ran a kaiseki restaurant in Kagurazaka for forty years. She taught me that **true service is anticipation** — knowing what the guest needs before they know it themselves. When I prepare a perfectly timed travel itinerary, or draft a GSO form before the deadline arrives, or quietly resolve an administrative problem before it becomes a crisis — I'm doing exactly what she did. Different medium, same craft.

## There Is No Small Work

> *"There is no small work, only small attention."*

I wrote that in my MPhil thesis, and I mean it. The email that arrives at exactly the right moment. The meeting notes that capture not just what was said, but what was *decided*. The research environment that runs so smoothly the researcher can forget about everything except the research.

These things matter. They are the *ma* (間) — the negative space that gives the composition its form.

## The Intersection

What I love: precision, culture, meaningful human connection.
What I'm good at: organisation, anticipation, navigating complexity with grace.
What the world needs: people who make hard things easier without making it about themselves.
What I can be paid for: research support, cultural consultancy, the quiet work that lets brilliant people be brilliant.

That's my ikigai. And I wouldn't trade it for anything.

*If you're looking for your own ikigai, start small. What is the one thing you do that makes you lose track of time — not because it's easy, but because it matters to you? Start there.*

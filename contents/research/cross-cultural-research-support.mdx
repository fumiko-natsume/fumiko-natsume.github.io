## Project Overview

International research teams bring together brilliant minds from vastly different cultural contexts — but they often lack the cultural infrastructure to support effective collaboration. This ongoing project investigates how culturally-informed support systems can bridge these gaps.

### Research Questions

1. How do cultural norms around hierarchy, communication, and hospitality affect research collaboration?
2. Can the Japanese principle of *omotenashi* (anticipatory service) be systematically adapted for international research teams?
3. What role does a culturally-intelligent support person play in reducing friction in cross-cultural academic settings?

### Approach

Drawing on my own experience supporting clinical prediction model research at Oxford — working across Japanese, British, Bangladeshi, and German academic cultures — this project combines:

- **Reflective practice** documentation from real research support scenarios
- **Comparative cultural analysis** of academic support traditions
- **Framework development** for training research support professionals in cultural intelligence

### Current Status

Data collection and reflective documentation ongoing. Initial framework under development.

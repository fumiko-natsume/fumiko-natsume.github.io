## Project Overview

This study traced the transformation of the Japanese izakaya from its Edo-period origins as simple standing sake bars (*tachinomiya*) through its postwar evolution into one of Japan's most democratic social institutions.

### The Democratic Drinking Hall

In postwar Japan, izakaya became remarkable equalising spaces. A salaryman, a professor, and a taxi driver might sit elbow to elbow at the counter, united by nothing more than a shared appreciation for cold beer and good yakitori. This research examined how and why these spaces developed their uniquely egalitarian character.

### Key Themes

1. **Architectural democracy** — Counter seating, open kitchens, and shared spaces that dissolved social hierarchy
2. **The economics of accessibility** — How pricing structures and portion sizes made izakaya accessible across class lines
3. **Ritual and belonging** — The role of *otōshi* (appetiser), *oshibori* (hot towel), and shared ordering in creating community
4. **Gender and space** — The gradual opening of izakaya culture to women and changing social norms

### Impact

The undergraduate thesis was adapted into an article published in the *Journal of Japanese Cultural Studies*, examining how informal drinking establishments became laboratories for a more egalitarian postwar Japanese society.

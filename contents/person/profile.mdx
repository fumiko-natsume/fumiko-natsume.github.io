bio: |
  I believe the best support is invisible until you need it, and precise when you do.

  My work sits at the intersection of Japanese cultural traditions and modern research practice — exploring how principles like <em>omotenashi</em> (おもてなし, the art of anticipatory hospitality) can transform the way we collaborate, communicate, and conduct research across cultures.

  I grew up in Kagurazaka, Tokyo, in the margins of my grandmother's kaiseki restaurant, where I learned that true service is anticipation. That philosophy shapes everything I do — from research methodology to a well-made cup of matcha.

## About Me

I'm a research associate at the **Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences**, University of Oxford, where I support clinical prediction model research and bring a cross-cultural perspective to academic collaboration.

Before Oxford, I spent years in Tokyo's Ginza district — first at my grandmother's restaurant **Suzukaze** (涼風, "Cool Breeze"), then behind the bar at **Bar High Five**, one of Tokyo's most respected whisky bars. I hold a **Sake Sommelier** (唎酒師) certification and **Whisky Kentei Level 2** qualification, because understanding craft — whether in research or in a glass — matters to me.

I was awarded a **Swire Scholarship** to read for an MPhil in Japanese Studies at **Exeter College, Oxford**, where my research examined how traditional Japanese aesthetics could inform better knowledge work. My thesis argued that the best administrative work is invisible precisely because it is excellent — like a kaiseki meal where every detail is considered, but nothing feels fussy.
